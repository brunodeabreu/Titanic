## Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster


As I am learning Data science and data analytics this is onf of my first model and challange from  <https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>, using logistic regression and R

### The Dataset

A Kaggle fornece 2 datasets:

* dataset de treino (train.csv)
* dataset de test (test.csv)

```{r}
#dimensão dataset de treino
dim(train)

#dimensão dataset de teste
dim(test)
```


```{r,include=FALSE}

train$Name <- as.character(train$Name)
test$Name <- as.character(test$Name)

train$Survived <- factor(train$Survived)
train$Pclass <- factor(train$Pclass)
train$Parch <- factor(train$Parch)
train$SibSp <- factor(train$SibSp)
train$Sex <- factor(train$Sex)

test$Parch <- factor(test$Parch)
test$Pclass <- factor(test$Pclass)

train$Age[is.na(train$Age)] <- mean(train$Age, na.rm = T)
test$Age[is.na(test$Age)] = mean(test$Age, na.rm = T)

```


After some data cleanup and data transformation we have converted some feature as factor (survived, Pclass, Sex, etc) , also adjusting NA from Age using mean function, we did some data exploring ploting some ghrafics using ggplot, we can see that women survided more than the mans, also the passagers from first class.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(train, aes(Sex )) +geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(Survived)))

ggplot(train, aes(Pclass)) + geom_bar(aes(fill=factor(Survived)), alpha=0.6)

```


### The model

Created the model using4 feature  ( Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare)

```{r,include=FALSE}
head(subset(train,select=c(2,3,5,6,8,8,10,12)),4)

modelo1  = glm(Survived ~. , data = subset(train,select=c(2,3,5,6)), family = binomial)

```
```{r}
summary(modelo1)
```


### Prediction

Using the predict function based on the model we have the follow results that was submited to kaggle with 0.76555 score

```{r}

predicted <- predict(modelo1, newdata = subset(test,select=c(2,4,5,6)), type = "response")
test$p[predicted >= 0.5] = 1
test$p[predicted < 0.5] = 0


solution <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$p)
head(solution,10)


```


### Confusion Matrix


From confusion matrix we could see that my model predict corrected that 514 died and 189 survived
```{r}

MC <- table(train$Survived, predict(modelo1) > 0.5)
MC

```

### Accuracy

The model have a accucay of 78.9%



```{r}

ACC <- sum(diag(MC))/sum(MC)
show (ACC)

```

### Precision

Also the precision was 84%

```{r}
precision <- MC[2,2]/sum(MC[,2])
precision

```


### Error

The model error was 21%


```{r}
error <- 1 - ACC
error

```




```{r,include=FALSE}
write.csv(solution, file = 'log_mod_Solution.csv', row.names = F)
```
